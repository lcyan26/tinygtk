This directory holds a stripped down version of Dov Grobgeld's FriBidi
library. The fribidi version that fribidi.patch is against was
obtained with "cvs up -D '4/16/2001'" from the fribidi cvs repository.

Like Pango, FriBidi is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License - see the file COPYING in the toplevel
directory of the Pango distribution.

From the README of Fribidi:


This is is FriBidi, a Free Implementation of the Unicode BiDi algorithm.

Background
==========
One of the missing links stopping the penetration of free software in
Israel is the lack of support for Hebrew. In order to have proper
Hebrew support, the BiDi algorithm must be implemented. It is my hope
that this library will stimulate more Hebrew free software.

Of course the BiDi algorithm is not limited to Hebrew, so I expect 
that our Arab neighbors will also find this software useful.

Audience
========

It is my hope that this library will stimulate the implementation of
Hebrew and Arabic in lots of free software. Here is a small list of
projects that would benifit from the use of the FriBidi library, but
of course there are many more: Wine, Mozilla, Gtk, Gnome, Qt, KDE,
AbiWord, lynx.

Downloading
===========

Notes
=====

- shell fragment to generate fribidi.patch:

 echo -n "" > fribidi.patch
 for i in fribidi.c fribidi_get_type.c fribidi_tables.i fribidi_types.h ; do
   diff -u ~/cvs/fribidi/$i $i >> fribidi.patch
 done

- Shell fragment to update from fribidi

 for i in fribidi.c fribidi_get_type.c fribidi_tables.i fribidi_types.h ; do
   cp ~/cvs/fribidi/$i .
 done
 patch < fribidi.patch
 
 (And fix rejects)

- Current fribidi.patch is against fribidi CVS with -D "15 Apr 2001"
